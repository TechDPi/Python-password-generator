# Python-password-generator
This is my password generator using Python.

The user can decide the lenght of the passwords choosing the numbers of :
- the letters they want to use
- the symbols they want to use
- the numbers they want to use

The program will generates 2 strong passwords using a  mix of upper and lowercase letters, as well as numbers and symbols strong enough to provides great security.
One of the two passowrd will be also fully randomised.
